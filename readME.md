## Introduction
This section provides a brief introduction to Python, a versatile and powerful programming language used in a wide range of applications, from simple scripts to complex machine learning algorithms.

### 1. Using `print()` Function
The `print()` function in Python is used to output text or other data to the standard output device (usually the terminal).

### Single Line Printing
To print text simply on a single line:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
### Multi Line Printing
To print text simply on multiple lines:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
print("Hello, World!")
print("Hello, World!")
```
### OR the pro way
By using "\n" which stands for next line.
```python
print("Hello, World!\nHello, World!\nHello, World!")
```

### 2. Using `input()` Function
The `input()` function in Python allows the program to pause and wait for user input, which can be useful for interactive applications. This function reads a line from input, converts it into a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns it.

### Usage
Prompt the user to enter some text and store it in a variable:
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
```
Then printing it:
```python
print(name)
```
